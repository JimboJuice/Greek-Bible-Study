Open Greek New Testament Project

[Open Hebrew Bible Project is now available at: https://github.com/eliranwong/OpenHB]
Fruits of both Open Greek New Testament Project and Open Hebrew Hebrew Project will be integrated together in a forthcoming Marvel.bible.

Open Greek New Testament Project aims to:

    offer a FREE NA-equivalent text of Greek New Testament, compiled from open-resources;
    align a FREE NA-equivalent Greek New Testament with a group of high-quality and open-source materials;
    develop an online reader for FREE ACCESS of major resources integrated in this project. [OpenGNT.com]

The FREE NA-equivalent text is named as "Open Greek New Testament [OGNT]". The text of OGNT was built upon and compiled from a group of high-quality scholarly materials. It serves as the base text for the rest of the project. This provides all bible readers, students or scholars a FREE text of Greek New Testament, which is the closest equivalent to the text of NA28 / NA27, for studies or research purposes.

As the text of OGNT is close to the text of NA28 / NA27, OGNT is a very good candidate for bridging a free Greek New Testament text with resources, which were originally keyed to the text of NA28 / NA27. So far, Open Greek New Testament Project has successfully aligned the text of OGNT with various scholarly resources, e.g. Tyndale Amalgamated NT Tagged texts, OpenText Linguisitic Annotations, Levinsohn Greek New Testament Features, Mounce Greek-English Dictionary, Berean interlinear translations, etc.

Upgraded to Version 3

25 August 2018: The base text of OpenGNT project had been upgraded to version 3. Previous versions, 1 & 2, are no longer supported.

There are 2 major files (file description is available HERE):

    Base Text of OGNT: OpenGNT_BASE_TEXT.zip
    Keyed Features and Mapping IDs: OpenGNT_keyedFeatures.csv.zip

The base text of OpenGNT project, OGNT, is currently the closest equivalent to the text of NA28.

The base text and the rest of Open Greek New Testament Project is released under a public license described below.

Comparison between OGNT and NA28 is briefly described HERE.
Source: A Brief History

Previous Versions (versions 1 & 2)

Previous two versions of the base text of OpenGNT project were compiled from TANTT - Tyndale Amalgamated NT Tagged texts. They are now replaced by the latest version (version 3). No support will be provided for the previous versions.

The Latest Version (version 3)

The latest base text of Open Greek New Testament Project, OGNT in short, was compiled from Berean Greek Bible and its associated database, which is primarily based on the Greek New Testament, Η ΚΑΙΝΗ ΔΙΑΘΗΚΗ, edited by Eberhard Nestle, published in 1904 by the British and Foreign Bible Society.

The Greek New Testament (Nestle, 1904) is now a public domain document worldwide, without any limitations for use or copyright issues. The Berean Bible Translation Committee adopted it years ago as the base text for developing Berean Greek Bible and associated resources on New Testament.

The final text of Berean Greek Bible is primary based on Nestle Greek New Testament (1904), with modernisation of spellings and textual decisions reflecting the best and earliest manuscripts. In addition, Berean translation table marks some significant textual variants of popular critical Greek New Testament editions, with a set of symbols.

In August 2018, OpenGNT project was granted permission to integrate Berean Greek Bible and its associated data for compilation, mapping resources and distribution.

As the Greek New Testament (Nestle, 1904) shares the same heritage with later NA texts (e.g. NA27, NA28), it soon became obvious that Berean Greek data is a very good source for compiling a NA-equivalent text, which is free for both reading and mapping valuables resources based on NA27 / NA28.

Compilation of the Base Text of OGNT

Berean Greek Bible and its associated data (inclusive) were then taken into review and processed, for compilation of a NA-equivalent Greek New Testament. The compilation process is briefly described below:

    Original variant markers in Berean database (inclusive) were reviewed, a few of them were refined. A few missing variants from Byzantine text were added to the database. The were marked with "＋BYZ" in the database, formatted for compilation.
    BGB was compared with Bunning Heuristic Prototype Greek New Testament, BHP in short, released by Center for New Testament Restoration. The comparison considers major variants only, ignoring minor issues like movable ν, αλλ vs αλλα, etc. BHP was taken into weighing textual decisions, as it is one of the latest projects, reflecting the best and earliest manuscripts. The review results in adaptation of some BHP's readings in place of some BGB readings. They were marked with "＋BHP" in the database, formatted for compilation. Remarks: BHP was not available for consideration in the original development of Berean Greek Bible, because it had not been published at the first launch of Berean Greek Bible.
    All TR, BYZ, WH, NE variants, originally marked in Berean database with symbols "{} ⧼⧽ () 〈〉", and some of SBL variants, marked with "〈〉", were taken away from the compilation.
    Verses containing ⇔ in original Berean database were reviewed and compared with other free GNT editons (i.e. TR, BYZ, WH, SBL, BHP). Word order in 71 verses were adapted from other editions and were documented HERE.
    Berean Greek Bible uses KJV versification. Original GNT's versification (Nestle 1904) had been worked out, with minor variations following SBLGNT's versification.
    Original punctuation from the Berean database were not included in the compilation.

Transparency

    To ensure transparency, the original database for compilation, including Berean Greek Data, and additional data mentioned above, is uploaded HERE.
    The process of the compilation is repeatable through the use of a simple Python script uploaded HERE. The script is provided for the sake of transparency. In addition, it may be useful for validation or checking.

To use the script:

    unzip file "source_BereanGreekBible_Inclusive.csv.zip"
    place files "berean_tablesInclusive.csv" and "compileOGNT.py" in the same folder
    run command "python compileOGNT.py"

A NA-Equivalent Text

The resulting text is suprisingly very close to the text of NA28. Apart from minor orthographical variations, it only has a total of 61 words different from the text of NA28. The text is now taken as the latest version (version 3) of the base text of Open Greek New Testament Project, replacing all previous versions. It is not only the closest equivalent to the text of NA28 / NA27, but also the best FREE candidate for mapping resources originally keyed to NA28 / NA27, e.g. OpenText Linguistic Annotations, Levinsohn Greek New Testament discourse features.
